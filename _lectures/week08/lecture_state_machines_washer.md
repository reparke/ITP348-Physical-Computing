## In class Lab - Dishwashing Machine

* We are going to build a simple dish washing machine with three cycles
  * Economy
  * Deluxe
  * Super Deluxe
* Each cycle will wash and dry the dishes in some manner
* The washer has a knob to change cycle (pot), a light to show the current state (RGB), and it starts automatically when the door is closed (magnetic switch)

## Cycles and States

| Cycles          | States                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Economy**     | **Idle** (white)        |
| **Deluxe**      | **HotWash** (red)       |
| **SuperDeluxe** | **ColdWash** (blue)     |
|                 | **RegularDry** (orange) |
|                 | **ExtraDry** (yellow)   |

## Transitions

- The potentiometer position determine the state by divide the potentiometer into 3 ranges
- The first state will start when the / switch is closed, and the next states will happen automatically on a `millis` timer

## Transitions

| Economy                          | Deluxe                           | SuperDeluxe                      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Idle** if until button pressed | **Idle** if until button pressed | **Idle** if until button pressed |
| **ColdWash** (2 min)             | **HotWash** (2 min)              | **HotWash** (2 min)              |
| **RegularDry** (2 min)           | **RegularDry** (2 min)           | **ExtraDry** (4 min)             |
| **Idle**                         | **Idle**                         | **Idle**                         |

## Components
* 1 RGB
* 1 potentiometer
* 1 magnetic switch (pushbutton will work too)

## Wiring Pin Guide

| LED                   | Photon 2 Pins |
| ---------------------------- | ---- |
| Magnetic Switch | D5 |
| RGB Red LED      | A2  |
| RGB Green LED | A5  |
| RGB Blue LED | D15 (MO) |
| Potentiometer |   A1   |

## General Approach

* We will need to create a way to represent the states and cycles using `enum`
* We will need to track state transitions with **variables** for state
* We will need to control timing with `millis()`

* What does `loop()` do
  * calculate new state
  * update the timing of the new state
  * update the RGB light for the new state
## State Transition Diagram

- State transitions can often be represented with circle for the state
- Arrows represent the flow from one state to another
- Next to each arrow are the conditions that start the transition
