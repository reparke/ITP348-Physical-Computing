## 		Things to implement

* [ ] Improvements
  * [ ] add late days column to Brightspace
  * [ ] create ["cheat sheet"](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) or video about basic workbench operations (flash, create project, import library)
  * [ ] tell students not to unclaim device
  * [ ] distribute grading among TAs
  * [ ] have TAs not attend every class
  * [ ] create better rubric for assignments by breaking down things like "game logic" to be more explicit so students can go down the checklist [like this](https://bytes.usc.edu/files/ee109/labs/lab4v/Lab4_Checkoff.pdf)
  * [ ] use something other than Brightspace for submissions
  * [ ] give list of items students should include in videos each week
  * [ ] summary of info. Things like what do wires do I connect to what pins for <whatever sensor> or  what is the generic formula for button-pushing detection? "living document". Whether that's a required part of assignments or a group doc different students add to each week, I've found that when students have to be accountable for something beyond their own notes, we tend to put  effort into it.
* [ ] need to order
  * [x] trimpots
  * [x] microservos
  * [x] microoled
  * [ ] particle argons
  * [ ] kit components for fall
* [ ] change kit: replace SPI OLED with [I2C OLED](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14532)
* [ ] revise proposal: give a format template to include exactly how their devices meet the requirements
* [x] recruit guest lecturers (x2)
* [ ] wk6: subscribe doesn't work with public events anymore :( so revise or eliminate partner magnetic switch example (summer)
* [ ] wk9-11: consider timing of car assignment and in-class work. Students are building car so they build something else. Maybe JSON cloud work can be covered during that time
* [ ] Re-evaluate Blynk--this seems to trigger lots of device disconnections
* [ ] Re-evaluate timer assignment--this caused significant device disconnection issues due to while loops
* [x] wk 0: create social issue assignment
* [x] wk 0: Create "behavioral norms"
* [ ] wk1: record software tools for reference
* [x] wk1: record c++ review and create bb quiz
* [x] wk3: create latch slides
* [ ] wk3: change die assignment to explicitly suggest on array for the pin labels, and multiple array for the dice labels (Summer) 
* [x] wk4: revise photoresistor slides / change questions
* [x] wk5: revise dashboard slides and exercise to reflect sending SINGLE values
* [x] wk 5: announce quiz for following week
* [ ] wk 5: use millis in next assignment (summer)
* [ ] wk 5: move enum and switch videos to week 6 (summer)
* [x] wk 6: create Bb quiz
* [x] wk5: add API graphic illustration for webhook
* [x] wk5: revise lab and slides to show TMP36, not photoresistor
* [x] wk6: revise Blynk lab
* [x] wk7: create lecture / lab activities for FSM day 2
* [x] wk8: revise alarm clock assignment to use FSM **and** Blynk (for blynk, use either simple buttons or "time input" to set alarm time)
* [x] wk11: may be too much dashboard content; consider moving single data point for initial state to earlier week
* [ ] wk10: review initial state code. need if JSON needs to be covered first
* [ ] wk11: inquire about future class TAs and kit TA
* [ ] wk12: revise Brightspace project grading rubric (sensors and actuators worth 10 points each, remove UI)
* [x] general: try to incorporate `enum` or `switch` earlier in semester
* [x] wk11: building smart watch: need to text and pictures to use velcro
* [x] account for wellness days in schedule
* [x] account for extra two weeks in schedule
* [x] replace IFTTT with Blynk

### Feedback

* Took about 1 hour
* soldering was fun but really simple. It would be cool to have a second, more complex circuit

# **Skipped / Eliminated**

## BLE Health Service

- The goal was to send a temperature from Argon to Bluefruit app but it rarely worked

#### Lab - ble_health_temp_start

- Distribute github link to download (post on slides)
- Describe project goals
- Explain **argon_ble_setup.h** at a high level
  - Have students change **DEVICE_NAME**
- Draw picture of how temperature data is organized
  - 6 bytes total
  - byte 1: 8 bits of flags
  - bytes 2-5: 4 byte floating point number
  - byte 6: temperature type
- Define constants and globals
  - UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS
  - prevUpdate = 0;  // time of last update in millis()
  - float prevTempF = -1.0;        // previous temperature in Fahr
  - uint8_t batteryLevel = -1;     // battery level percentage [0-100]
- Write **loop()** together
- Write **getTemp()** together
  - Call       **update_ble_temperature**
- Write **getBatteryLevel()** together
  - call update_ble_battery_level



## LCD screen

#### Lecture

- I2C LCD
- Ultrasonic distance sensor

#### Lab

- exercises in slides

### Feedback

- Fail.
- The LCD devices only worked for half the students (either faulty devices or bad libraries). Definitely DO NOT use LCDs again
- Ultrasonic sensor worked mostly

## ThingSpeak 

### Day 2

### Lecture

- OLED graphics
- walk through of Thingspeak (==need to make slides==)
  - Create webhook in Particle
  - send temperature data through `Particle.publish` to thingspeak

### Feedback day1

- Recommend **NOT** using thingsspeak again. Thingspeak integration with webhook is fairly simple. It is also possible to discuss JSON to send multiple values.
- However, thingsspeak doesn't have a way to send commands to Argon (have to use something like IFTTT)

### Assignment

- Due start of current week: A8 - Alarm clock
- Given out start of current week: ==A9 - Bluetooth car== part 1 (build chassis only)

### Day 1 (following week)

#### Lecture

- Finish ThingSpeak integration with multiple values as JSON

#### Lab

- Finish ThingSpeak integration with multiple values as JSON walk through example

#### Lecture

- Explain what APIs are; show them a few public ones
- Discuss [weather stack](https://weatherstack.com/) show example call
- show JSON slides
- walkthrough integration
- write json code together

#### Lab

- Create [weather stack](https://weatherstack.com/) account
- Have them use their own api key to view JSON in a browser (use formatter online if necessary
- Create webhook in Particle
- Copy code from particle publishing and subscribing
- Test: publish request and see if subscribe code retrieves JSON data

## IFTTT

#### Lecture

- IFTTT

#### Guided activity

- set up IFTTT [https://ifttt.com/create](https://ifttt.com/create)
- Install iOS / Android app
- how do create an alarm?
  - If Particle - Publish <event name> open
  - Then send notification
  - Could enhance by using your location
  - set up location trigger to enter or exit that sets a variable
  - then change publish event
- Create button
- **Ask students to work in pairs and come up with a cool idea**

#### Lecture

* ==may need more here==
* Also could work on reaction timer because it is challenging
* Could cover [IFTTT webhooks](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks) but they require HTML / JS editing to work, and they require JSON to send text values

#### Feedback

- Some of the IFTTT got a little bumpy but generally this was a good amount of material and worked well
